# [WeatherApp :umbrella:](https://gabrielcerri.github.io/Weather/) 



Using the API from [weatherapi](http://www.weatherapi.com/) I worked on a web that, based on your geolocation, shows you:

  * Temperature in °C (Celsius).
  * Thermal sensation in °C (Celsius)
  * City, Province or State, Country.
  * Date y time in real time.
  * Description (with text and an icon) of the forecast (e.g: clear sky :sunny:)
  * Adaptable language depending on your geolocation.

## Technologies that I used :computer: :

  * HTML
  * CSS
  * JAVASCRIPT using XMLHttpRequest and then turning it in a  JSON File with JSON.parse().
